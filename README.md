My Wardley Mapping Stuff (see: https://medium.com/wardleymaps)

This is a canvas for the Archi tool (https://www.archimatetool.com/), that implements
Archimate 3 by the Open Group.

You can install and use this binray in archicanvas format to create a Wardley map,
as of Archi 4.5 use rev2 of the canvas binary.
Hope this helps.

Have fun, -joke
